Heroes of Pymoli
The Juypter file attached is my solution for the Heroes of Pymoli challenge
I observed the following 3 data trends fro the game:
1. The gender of the players is disproportionally males, 84% to 14% female, excluding the other 2% who failed to disgnate a gender. Based on this finding, I 
 recommend the game developers attempt to develop more games features that would appeal to females.
2. The 20 to 29 year old age group provided 466 of the 780 total purchases, accounting for 60% of purchases. If the age bracket is increased to 15 - 34, the total purchase percent is 86%. I recommend focusing on this age bracket during game development to increase the in app purchases and to integrate crosss promotional marketing into the game that appeasl to this age bracket. This would increase and diversify company revenues. 
3. The in app purchase items should be re-evaluated for the worst performing group. Included in that group would be the items that have only sold 1 or 2 times at an average
of less than $2.00. These items are not attracting buyers and should either have the power/importance in the game made stronger or remove them all together and focus development
on the top 20 performing items for purchase.
